# media-content-sentiment-analysis
Team course project analyzing topics and sentiment in North American news media using annotation and TF-IDF.

This repository contains a course project on topic and sentiment analysis of North American news media, using a case study on media coverage of Taylor Swift.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project was to analyze how a prominent public figure is portrayed in North American news media by identifying:
- The main themes present in media coverage
- The sentiment associated with these narratives (positive, neutral, negative)

The project combines qualitative annotation with quantitative text analysis to provide interpretable insights into media narratives.

## Data
- Approximately 500 news articles collected from a diverse set of North American news outlets
- Articles were annotated for topics and sentiment following a predefined coding guide

## Methodology
- Open coding to define key thematic categories
- Manual annotation of articles for topic and sentiment
- TF-IDF-based keyword analysis to characterize themes
- Interpretation of results across topics and sentiment categories

## Contribution
This was a **team course project**.  
My main contributions focused on:
- Data preparation and annotation methodology
- Interpretation of analytical results and media narratives
- Writing key parts of the final report, including the main discussion section

The code in this repository supports the data processing and analysis pipeline developed collaboratively by the team.
